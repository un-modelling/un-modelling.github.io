    <h2>Economy-wide modelling training concludes in Costa Rica</h2>

    <strong>7-10 August 2016</strong>

    <p>Capacity development activities in modelling tools continued in Costa Rica with the implementation of the 3rd Economy-wide modelling workshop (San José, 7-10 August). The training, conducted by DESA consultant Dr. Martin Cicowiez, focused on the CGE-UNDESA dynamic model for the country. It assessed different shocks to the economy such as increases in energy efficiency, increased investments in infrastructure and other simulations. Due to the important insights the CGE-UNDESA model has provided, the participants have requested another workshop to further discuss the simulations prepared by the country team. The additional workshop will sharpen the main findings from the model in preparation for a presentation of policy insights to medium and high level government officials. This is evidence of the importance of the capacity development work carried out in countries to support them using robust quantitative modelling tools to inform sustainable development policies.</p>

    <h2>Scoping mission to Dakar is completed</h2>

    <strong>28-31 July 2017</strong>

    <p>Between July 28 and 31, Eduardo carried out a pre-scoping mission to Dakar, Senegal, to assess interest and existing governmental capacity for the implementation of a UNDESA project aiming to build capacities in integrated methodologies to support evidence-based sustainable development policies in Africa. UNDP country office and New York Strategic Unit will also take part of this project. The mission included meetings with the office of the Prime Minister, the Ministry of Finance, Economy and Planning at various levels, the Ministry of Energy, the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development, the Ministry of Agriculture, the National Agency of Civil Aviation and Meteorology, and the UNDP Country Director. The mission found strong interest in the project from all ministries and specialized departments within them. There is also pre-existing capacity in energy, dynamic systems, water management and climate modelling, which is a valuable input for the development of a country project. However, no significant capacity on multi-sectorial integrated modelling was found, which is where this project will be of most use. The proposed project was therefore perceived as effectively adding to the analytical capacity of the country. The government of Senegal will be discussing how to coordinate the project, if there is a decision to approve the project for implementation. It will also decide on the contributions the government could make for implementation of the project.</p>

    <h2>Modelling Sustainable Development in Bolivia</h2>

    <p>Since 2006, UN DESA and UNDP, have been supporting the Plurinational State of Bolivia to strengthen the analytical capacities of government officials to inform development policies by using modelling tools. Through several capacity development projects, economy-wide and energy systems models have been transferred and a set of policy scenarios have been developed to address key issues of interest to the government.  This collaboration has resulted in several contributions, including publications and policy notes prepared by government officials to disseminate the results and the findings of the modelling assessments.  An inter-ministerial modelling team of government officials has been established that is now capable to undertake policy analysis in response to requests from senior decision-makers.</p>

    <img src="/images/news-events/c66911d0a9eb905299582ea876c86e61.jpg">

    <h3>Bolivia: Impact of capacity development shaping policies in Bolivia</h3>

    <p>The utility of such projects has been highlighted on several occasions. For example, one of the general equilibrium models transferred by UNDESA was useful for informing the 2025 Patriotic Agenda by estimating GDP growth and government budget requirements to finance the implementation of plans and programs. The OSeMOSYS energy model enabled the Unit for Social and Economic Policy Analysis (UDAPE) of the Ministry of Development Planning to contribute analysis to support an assessment of energy sector development to help establish Bolivia's Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) under the Paris agreement. Furthermore, the Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning system of the country (LEAP) was updated by UNDESA, in collaboration with the Royal Institute of Technology of Sweden (KTH), and UNDP support. As a result of this, a conference was organized to disseminate the results of both energy models to a wide audience, addressing both contributions and limitations to key features of Bolivia’s Plan for Economic and Social Development 2016-2020 (PDES).  Selected policy notes using the energy models were used to inform the Energy Development Plan of the Ministry of Hydrocarbons.</p>

    <img src="/images/news-events/6356773ae86d853e714a2d97444c7f6b.jpg">

    <p>Likewise, in the Symposium "Promotion of inclusive and responsible public administration for sustainable development" that took place on March 16 and 17, 2016, Mrs. Mirna Mariscal, Subdirector of Macroeconomic Policy of UDAPE, highlighted the importance of capacity development projects to strengthen the technical expertise of the Government in the use and improvement of economic and energy models.</p>

    <p>The tools that are part of the UNDESA-UNDP portfolio include economy-wide models with modules in energy, health and human development; micro-simulations to assess the impact of policies on poverty dynamics and other household socio-economic indicators; energy systems models and energy planning. Currently, an integrated methodology of climate, land use, energy and water (CLEWs) is under development, which facilitates the analyses of interrelationships between the three dimensions of sustainable development -economic, environmental and social- in policy design and planning.</p>

    <p>Bolivia’s continuous engagement with the modelling tools and the evidence of their use to inform policies is a good example of the importance of making innovative and tailored models accessible to developing countries.</p>
